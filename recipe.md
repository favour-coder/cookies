Preparation
Grease a large (at least 8-inch (20 cm) diameter) microwave-safe plate with butter.
In a medium bowl, use a whisk or fork to stir together the butter, sugar. Add vanilla extract.
Add the egg and stir to combine.
Add the flour and salt and stir until just incorporated
Fold in 5 tablespoons of the chocolate chips.
Scoop the dough into a mound at the center of the prepared plate. Lightly press the remaining chocolate chips into the top of the dough.
Microwave until the cookie is dry on top and springs back when lightly pressed in the center, about 1Â½ minutes. Let sit for a few minutes to cool.
Enjoy!
